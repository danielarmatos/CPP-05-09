# CPP01
Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the projects related to the C++ Modules at 42 School.

## Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions

The module focuses on concepts related to repetition (loops) and exception handling in C++.

## Module 06: Casts

Module 06 explores the various types of casts in C++. Understanding type casting is essential for working with different data types and ensuring proper conversions.

## Module 07: Templates

Module 07 is designed to help us understand Templates in CPP. Templates provide a powerful mechanism for generic programming, allowing to write functions and classes that work with any data type.

## Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms

Module 08 focuses on templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in CPP. I learned how to use and create templated containers, iterate over them, and apply algorithms to manipulate data efficiently.

## Module 09: Containers

Module 09 is designed to help us understand the containers in CPP. Containers are fundamental in C++, providing different data structures like vectors, lists, maps, and more. Understanding these containers is crucial for effective C++ programming.

Feel free to explore the projects in each module's directory for detailed implementations and solutions.
